Revision history for WWW-Pastebin-PastebinCom-API

0.003   2013-10-29
        - Fixed a broken test

0.002   2013-10-28
        - Added the "Getting A Users Information And Settings" API
          feature that I somehow managed to miss the first time around.
        - Fixed t/kwalitee.t to run only with RELEASE_TESTING
        - Added examples/get_user_info.pl
        - Fixed a bug where the user of the module would get strange
          and confusing errors if they forgot to get a user key or
          provide an API key
        - Updated the docs to mention that
          WWW::Pastebin::PastebinCom::Retrieve provides a more
          featureful paste grab--relying on HTML parsing-- that
          pastebin's API doesn't (what would I likely want to know:
          user's settings or the expiry of the paste? The former is in
          the API the latter isn't... logic for you ~_~)
